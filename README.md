# Request module - morning challenge

### What is the Node request module?

The [request module](https://github.com/request/request) helps to make HTTP requests as simple as possible. The module preforms a similar task to the Node http and https core module but it makes the process much simpler. [Here](http://stackabuse.com/the-node-js-request-module/) is a brilliant article on the request module. 

### What is a HTTP request? 

HTTP requests are used whenever you want to fetch a file from a server, this could be any information on a database. 
HTTP is a request/response protocol, which means your computer sends a request for some data from a server (GET request) and will receive some data in response.

### When would I need to use the request module? 

Example 1 - I would like to GET my profile-photo.png from the database to display on my homepage. 

Example 2 - I would like to use the request module to make a HTTP request to the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/), to find out which busses go between London Brige and Bethnal Green.
