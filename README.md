# Request module - morning challenge

### What is the Node request module?

The [request module](https://github.com/request/request) helps to make HTTP calls as simple as possible. The module preforms a similar task to the Node http and https core modules but it makes the process much simpler. 

### What is a HTTP request? 

HTTP requests are used whenever you want to fetch a file from a server, this could be any information on a database. 
HTTP is a request/response protocol, which means your computer sends a request for a file from a server (GET request) and will receive a response.

### When would I need to use the request module? 

Example 1 - I would like to GET my profile-photo.png from the database to display on my homepage. 

Example 2 - I would like to use the request module to make a HTTP call to the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/), to find out which busses go between London Brige and Bethnal Green.
